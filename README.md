### States

* Create a new model in your project - call it State (name, capital, population, area).
* Using ActiveRecord in the rails c:
* Create 10 new States
** Practice the different ways of querying a State -
** All States, Finding One State, the First and Last States, etc.
** Select a State to update - change some of its data - and save it
** Delete one of your States
** Now set up a new controller, called Country
* With three pages: all_states, top_five_pop, top_five_area
* Use Active Record calls in the controller to populate the views (you can probably venture a guess what data we're looking for in each page). In Top Five Pop, we want them ordered by population; Top Five Area, ordered by area.
